Abstract:
The aim of the research is to discuss forms of measurement and analytics
which serve to achieve an expanding footprint for online marketplace “Trice”.
Companies are increasingly using online communities to create value for the
firm and their customers. To date, evidence regarding the effectiveness of online
communities is widely available. In this paper we carry out a detailed study with
live data from the business. The study is underpinned by a Sample survey of
varied individuals, Sample size- 199. Further there is a detailed study carried
out for Market basket analysis, RFM, LTV. The result is an outcome of
amalgamated concurrence of survey and Statistical analysis. The results show
there is strong traction for the brand and awareness in the market it is operating.
The study points to few important outcomes, Namely: There is a strong loyal
customer base, which brings in business and profits. In recent years , especially
after the event of COVID 19, the traction of the business has slowed down and
the latest customer acquisition by expanded marketing is not revenue accretive.
The survey provides insight on the latest preferences of the customers and their
areas of interest, which should be further taken up by the “Trice”marketing
team. The study proposes to the company in starting a “loyalty program” which
will lead to customer retention thereby assisting in getting more cross-sell and
upsell opportunities.
Key words: Association rule mining, Apriori Algorithm, Market Basket Analysis,

Introduction:
“Trice” is an online neighbourhood marketplace which is based on the simple
principle of creating a connected community. Trice helps build thriving and
active residential communities by promoting local commerce in helping likeminded people. The app creates a positive social impact empowering women,

tools and new approaches to understand customer journeys.
“Trice” currently has strong patronage with the local community they work in
and has several “Marquee investors”. “Trice” wishes to expand its footprint and
hence this research study is commissioned.
