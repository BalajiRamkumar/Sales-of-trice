Abstract:
The aim of the research is to discuss forms of measurement and analytics
which serve to achieve an expanding footprint for online marketplace “Trice”.
Companies are increasingly using online communities to create value for the
firm and their customers. To date, evidence regarding the effectiveness of online
communities is widely available. In this paper we carry out a detailed study with
live data from the business. The study is underpinned by a Sample survey of
varied individuals, Sample size- 199. Further there is a detailed study carried
out for Market basket analysis, RFM, LTV. The result is an outcome of
amalgamated concurrence of survey and Statistical analysis. The results show
there is strong traction for the brand and awareness in the market it is operating.
The study points to few important outcomes, Namely: There is a strong loyal
customer base, which brings in business and profits. In recent years , especially
after the event of COVID 19, the traction of the business has slowed down and
the latest customer acquisition by expanded marketing is not revenue accretive.
The survey provides insight on the latest preferences of the customers and their
areas of interest, which should be further taken up by the “Trice”marketing
team. The study proposes to the company in starting a “loyalty program” which
will lead to customer retention thereby assisting in getting more cross-sell and
upsell opportunities.
Key words: Association rule mining, Apriori Algorithm, Market Basket Analysis,
Big Data, Quantitative survey, RFM Analysis, Customer LTV, Neighbourhood app
Introduction:
“Trice” is an online neighbourhood marketplace which is based on the simple
principle of creating a connected community. Trice helps build thriving and
active residential communities by promoting local commerce in helping likeminded people. The app creates a positive social impact empowering women,
creating local employment thereby stimulating the local economy.
Trice operates in a constantly changing environment, which uses sophisticated
tools and new approaches to understand customer journeys.
“Trice” currently has strong patronage with the local community they work in
and has several “Marquee investors”. “Trice” wishes to expand its footprint and
hence this research study is commissioned.
Further details about the business can be found in

Research Methodology:
The data collected is placed under different criteria to get the objective. 
Data Collection:
As part of the assignment process we have approached Trice Systems Pvt Ltd
Company and used there live data to analyse and see how we can use statistical
methods to infer as to what is happening and how they can improve their
customer experience
As part of data collection we have collected the below data and the reason for
the same is explained as below
Customer Master:
Order ID: This is the unique table that records each order and ties it to the
respective customer to analyse patterns and behavior, this table is unique and
cannot have duplicates
User ID: This is the table the uniquely identifies each customer and helpsidentify
what all he transacted and where all did he travel along in the app, what are his
favourite things on the store, what are his demographics, what he orders and
dosent order
Order Date: Helps us in identifying a pattern as to the frequency of his purchase,
is he a monthly purchases, weekly or daily, helps in targeting promotion before
his next purchase cycle
Order Type: This helps in identifying what is his favourite type on the app, Store
orders, Food orders, subscription orders etc, this helps in identifying if he is a
food lover or a planned purchaser etc
Store: Which vendor store the customer likes, this is based on the frequency of
his purchase which we can capture using the data available in the above tables
to triangulate his choice and preference
Service / Category: This helps in identifying at a service level what customer he
is, a meat lover, vegetarian, foodie, gamer etc
Bill Amount: This field helps in identifying what is the bill amount and when
taken in conjunction with order frequency gives us avg order value, avg cart
value, service wise bill value etc
Order Master
Order ID: This is the critical link that connects the customer table in relation with
order table as the unique common factor and identifier, without this link the
entire data becomes useless since we cannot establish the relation between
both the tables
Payment ID: This table identifies how the payment came in, what mode
customer used, what are his preferred usage mode, like Card, Net Banking, UPI,
COD, etc and based on this learning we can offer him any promotions as and
when they come
Store Name: Which vendor store the customer likes, this is based on the
frequency of his purchase which we can capture using the data available in the
above tables to triangulate his choice and preference
Product Name: This table identifies the name of the product that the customer
bought and analyzing this we can get his preferred product that he buys
frequently, in conjunction with other info we can arrive at the frequency bought,
regularity etc.
Survey
A detailed Survey is conducted with existing and new customers to understand
their motivation for using the product and expand the footprint. The survey also
detailed the areas of comfort and pain points. We designed the questionnaire
and it was released in various social media channels (whatsapp groups, emails
to existing clients) through formstack. The questionnaire was released on Oct 14
to 26. The responses are collected and analyzed deeper for business insights.
The model Questionnaire is attached to this paper for easy reference
The salient survey insights are as follows.
SERVICE VS FEATURES:
As per the above graph
● Customers who prefer apparel and accessories frequently have strong
preference for various payment options and ease of use.
● For Customers who prefer electronics, groceries and daily needs their
priority was after sales support.
● For customers who prefer Apparels and accessories, Service apps, have
strong preference to same day delivery.
● The above outcomes can be linked with Market basket analysis, RFM and
LTV models generated in more ways to gain deeper understanding
Overall survey report
● The outliers (i.e Age 16-20 & 65 +) use more service apps than any other
apps and they are mostly interested in loyalty programs and freebies than
that of any other services. 
● Groceries and food delivery are used more frequently than any other app
services which makes us understand that there is more demand for these
apps and this phenomenon was observed across all age spectrums.
● Delivery options and same day delivery is more preferred by our
customers and the least being bulk purchases and payment options
● The existing customers are very satisfied with the current refund/ refunds
policies and there are some challenges in options availability and
customer support
Pie support on importance and dissatisfaction of existing customers

● in service apps the frequently used one is Groceries and Daily Needs and
infrequent is Electronics and Appliances
● 66 people felt payment option is more important feature than any other
feature
● The most satisfaction came from the ease of using app and we need to
focus more on customer support as we got very less support in our survey
● The Highest amount of dissatisfaction is from customer support and
definitely needs some improvement
● Also need more focus on the likelihood of recommendation as it is again
dependant on the overall service
Market Basket Analysis
Data mining refers to extracting knowledge from a large amount of data. Market
basket analysis is a data mining technique to discover associations between
datasets. Association rule mining identifies relationships between a large set of
data items. When large quantities of data are constantly obtained and stored in
databases, several industries are becoming concerned about mining association
rules from their databases. For example, the detection of interesting association
relationships between large quantities of business transaction data can help in
catalog design, cross-marketing and various business decision making processes.
A typical example of association rule mining is market basket analysis. This
method examines customer buying patterns by identifying associations among
various items that customers place in their shopping baskets. The identification
of such associations can assist retailers expand marketing strategies by gaining
insight into which items are frequently purchased by customers. It is helpful to
examine the customer purchasing behavior and assists in increasing the sales
Market Basket Analysis is used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant
association rules. It is devised to operate on a database containing a lot of
transactions.
Association rules are normally written like this: {Diapers} -> {Beer} which means
that there is a strong relationship between customers that purchased diapers
and also purchased beer in the same transaction.
In the above example, the {Diaper} is the antecedent and the {Beer} is the
consequent. Both antecedents and consequent can have multiple items. In
other words, {Diaper, Gum} -> {Beer, Chips} is a valid rule.
Support is an indication of how frequently the itemset appears in the dataset.
The support of X with respect to T is defined as the proportion of transactions t
in the dataset which contains the itemset X.
!"##$%&'()*+,-"##$%&'(.*+/%01234567/89
Confidence is an indication of how often the rule has been found to be true.
The confidence value of a rule, X=>Y , with respect to a set of transactions T, is
the proportion of the transactions that contain X which also contain Y.
*$1:;<31=3'()*+,-"##$%&'()*+>-"##$%&'(+/%01234567/89
Lift is the ratio of the observed support to that expected if the two rules were
independent . The basic rule of thumb is that a lift value close to 1 means the
rules were completely independent. Lift values > 1 are generally more
“interesting” and could be indicative of a useful rule pattern.
?;:&'()*+,=$1:;<31=3'()*+>-"##$%&'*+/%01234567/@9
The Data Set:
The data set we used is “TriceMBA.csv”.It has 3 fields-UID( User ID), Service,
Count(quantity of items)
Variable Description Data Type
UID User ID of the customer Int
Service Availed services to the customer from Trice String
Count Number of times user ordered the service Int
Cleaning the data set:-
We got a raw data set “sale dump 36 months with cust ID.xlsx” from trice and
we removed the rows with null values. We took the field “Service” to find out
the frequent patterns instead of the item field because the items are of high
dimensional and they are nearly 23410 unique items. As Trice is a service based
application, we thought it would be more reasonable to choose the field
“service” to find the association between services offered by Trice.
Code:-
Mlxtend (machine learning extensions) is a Python library of useful tools for dayto-day data science tasks.
To install mlxtend, just execute

Numpy provides a high-performance multidimensional array and basic tools to
compute with and manipulate these arrays
import numpy as np
Pandas is a library of python used for data manipulation and analysis.
import pandas as pd
Downloading the dataset directly from Google Drive via Google Colab
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount ('/drive')
data = pd.read_csv('/drive/MyDrive/TriceMBA.csv')
The head() function is used to get the first n rows.
data.head()
basket_hot = (data
 .groupby(['UID', 'Service'])['Count']
 .sum().unstack().reset_index().fillna(0)
 .set_index('UID'))
One-hot encoding is essentially the representation of categorical variables as
binary vectors. These categorical values are first mapped to integer values. Each 
integer value is then represented as a binary vector that is all 0s (except the
index of the integer which is marked as 1).
def hot_encode(x):
 if(x<= 0):
 return 0
 if(x>= 1):
 return 1
This Pandas function application is used to apply a function to DataFrame, that
accepts and returns only one scalar value to every element of the
DataFrame.
Defining the hot encoding function to make the data suitable for the concerned
libraries
basket_encoded = basket_hot.applymap(hot_encode)
basket_hot = basket_encoded
basket_hot
We have taken a support count level at 15%
frq_items = apriori(basket_hot, min_support = 0.15, use_colnames = True)
frq_items
Pandas has a set option function that lets you customize some aspects of its
behavior.
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 10)
Building the models and analyzing the results
rules = association_rules(frq_items, metric ="lift", min_threshold = 1)
rules = rules.sort_values(['confidence', 'lift'], ascending =[False, False])
print(rules.head())
rules.to_excel('/drive/MyDrive/MBA_output.xlsx')
Market Basket Analysis Inference:
From the data we have, we observed 42 frequent pattern sets. Through support
count, we observed that the percentage of orders are more for services- Fruits
& Vegetables, Groceries, Sweets & Namkeens and Bread & Cakes.
Antecedents Consequents Support
({'Sweets & Namkeen'}) ({'Fruits & Vegetables'}) 0.313119436

({'Breads & Cakes'}) ({'Fruits & Vegetables'}) 0.234839577
({'Fruits & Vegetables'}) ({'Breads & Cakes'}) 0.234839577
Confidence is the probability that if a person buys an item A, then he will also
buy an item B.
Confidence that if a person buys bread & cakes, groceries, they may also buy
fruits and vegetables.Which has a 94% chance of being purchased.
Antecedents Consequents Confidence
({'Breads & Cakes', 'Groceries'}) ({'Fruits & Vegetables'}) 0.942044257
Curries and Rotis are having high lift values compared to other items. Which
means that these items are appearing more times in the same order.
If the lift value is greater than 1 indicates that the rule body and the rule head
appear more often together than expected, this means that the occurrence of
the rule body has a positive effect on the occurrence of the rule head.

RFM
Introduction:-
RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group
customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent
transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing
campaigns. The system assigns each customer numerical scores based on these
factors to provide an objective analysis. RFM analysis is based on the marketing
adage that "80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers."
RFM analysis ranks each customer on the following factors:
● Recency. How recent was the customer's last purchase? Customers
who recently made a purchase will still have the product on their mind
and are more likely to purchase or use the product again. Businesses
often measure recency in days. But, depending on the product, they
may measure it in years, weeks or even hours.
● Frequency. How often did this customer make a purchase in a given
period? Customers who purchased once are often more likely to
purchase again. Additionally, first time customers may be good targets
for follow-up advertising to convert them into more frequent
customers.
● Monetary. How much money did the customer spend in a given
period? Customers who spend a lot of money are more likely to spend
money in the future and have a high value to a business. In the case of
Trice, instead of total sales of the customer, average sales value was
taken to get better segmentation.
Trice RFM Analysis:- Below is the data, which is derived from RFM analysis on
TRICE customers with a score of 1 being the highest.

Insights:
● Our loyal customers which includes the best customers-1909 brings the
business of 16 cr. Trice as a business would intend to retain the 1909 loyal
customer base.
● We also noticed 1834 customers who are “At risk”,”Can’t Lose”,”About to
sleep” categories are our major areas to focus as per our research.
● In the recent customer survey conducted we identified that loyalty points
are important for customers who are very frequently purchasing apparel
and accessories and service app’s. The survey helped us identify the
customer preferences and was able to relate to the above data.
● The “customers needing attention”, “promising” provides a potential
business of 1.29 cr and TRICE feels the importance of retaining them with
more customer support and optimal discounts.
● “Recent customers” and “potential loyalist” in total has about 1980
customers makes us understand the need of anchoring in our platform.
● “Hibernating customers” needs to be activated by giving more preference
for targeted advertisements and helping them understand the need of
TRICE for them.
● Further insights can be gained by mapping individual customers to their
buying preference and insights gained in market basket analysis.
Code:-
We used Tableau for deriving the above summarized data.
The below images are self explanatory and the calculations are made in tableau
to arrive at the above data.

Lifetime Value(LTV)
Customer Lifetime Value
Customer Lifetime Value is the net present value of all future streams of profits
that a customer generates over the life of the relationship with the firm
“Success is getting the right customers … and keeping them,” – Charles Cawley,
Founder MBNA
Measuring CLV
CLV = Profit Margin * Margin Multiple – Acquisition Cost
CLV = m{r/(1+i-r)} – AC
Where m = annual margin
r = annual retention rate
i = discount rate
AC = acquisition cost
Margin multiple = r/(1+i-r)
Strategies to increase customer value
1. Customer acquisition
Customers can be acquired using methods such as
o Scaling up volume by spending more on existing channels or developing
new acquisition channels
o Improving performance by decreasing cost per acquisition or shifting mix
towards high-value customers
2. Customer expansion
Expansion can be done by various methods that include increase in usage,
upsell (switch customers to higher priced product or service), bundling or
cross-selling and reducing costs.
Customer Recommendation Systems
- Customer Recommender systems are popular in ecommerce and digital
content settings.
- They are useful in context involving a large number of users facing a large
number of products
- There is considerable heterogeneity in user preferences for attributes
- Users are unaware or uncertain about products
- Constantly evolving / cold start problems
- Recommender system algorithms include:
o Collaborative filtering: this can be User based or Item based
o Matrix Factorization methods: predicting unknown values using
latent factors involves finding the values of the user and item latent
factors that minimize the error sum of squares.
3. Customerretention
Customer Churn is a major impact metric for any organisation. Some of the
major causes of churn involve:
o Company’s poor ongoing customer experience (structural) or a specific
incident causes serious customer dissatisfaction (event-based)
o Competition having promotion (causes switching) and superior value
proposition in product or service
o Customer’s needs change
Impact of Retention on Market Share
The 3 drivers of retention and loyalty are:
o Experience
o Loyalty Programs
o Cross-selling
Salient features
- Customers are assets
- Lifetime Value of a customer is LV = m [r/(1+i-r)] – AC
- Three key levers of growth
o Customer acquisition (AC)
o Customer retention (r)
o Customer expansion (m)
Insights for Trice-CLV:
o Trice has observed a major downfall in customer lifetime value. There is a
trend in 2019 where we see a slight decline in LTV, however, due to covid,
the decline has continued and Trice has not been able to recover from the
impact
o In an effort to recover from this, Trice has pumped in more funds for
customer acquisition which did increase their customer base and to some
extent their sales numbers, but LTV has been negative since then clearly
showing us that acquisition alone isn’t an appropriate strategy to recovery.
o Trice will have to concentrate on the other 2 strategies, namely, expansion
and retention. They need to improve their retention rate for which they can
assess the problem areas and competition, and concurrently focus on
creating expansion methods of upselling, cross-selling, recommendation
systems to be able to increase their customer LTV
o In 2018, Trice acquired its most valuable customers with minimum spend and
maximum LTV, whereas in post covid times, they have burnt funds trying to
acquire customers and lost focus on retention.
o The company has only focused on registrations/sign-ups which can be seen
from the recent LTV and Revenue per customer data, that majority of these
customers have not ordered even once. This depicts another area that needs
more focus is to bring in valuable customers that could actually purchase
from Trice instead of trying to increase the customer base.
o Loyalty programs paired up with cross-sell and upsell could be a potential
best way for Trice to increase their retention rates.
o Incorporating our findings from the survey with the insights gained from the
LTV model, we conclude that feature expansion (recommendations, upsell,
cross-sell) paired with a loyalty program for customer retention will help
Trice recover and thrive. Another example of the need for expansion was the
survey response regarding the need for more payment options.
o When it comes to the age group of 16-20 and their interest in freebies, Trice
should measure them up against their LTV for that segment and then decide
if pumping in more money for them is beneficial at all.
Acknowledgements:
We thank the management of the app “Trice” for the opportunity to carry out
this study. They have been most helpful in providing the support and
uninterrupted data in time and a deep desire to understand . We would also
like to mention special thanks to Prof. Gaurav Nagpal who took special interest
in the “Experiential learning” exercise , where he spent his valuable time for
our benefit.
Results/Conclusion:
The potential for the neighbourhood app “Trice” is substantial from a technical
as well as an economical point of view : implying great hitherto untapped
business opportunities. The app has a unique business model which is not found
in scale across the world . The nearest comparable is “Nextdoor” in the US. One
in three US Households are on the platform, hence it is prudent to consider there
is abundant scope for “Trice” to grow. The Indian market is always price
conscious and this was clearly demonstrated in the survey results and the
addition of the new customer base which is not revenue accretive. Through the
Market basket analysis it is clear that there is certain correlation between
products being sold in the app. Through RFM the research team identified there
is a group of customers who are currently on the verge of disconnecting from
the app, The “Trice” app team needs to focus on them and retain them. Trice
has spent a considerable amount of money for the customer acquisition which
has surely increased the customer base but has led to a negative LTV.
